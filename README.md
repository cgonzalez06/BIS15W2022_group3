BIS15L final project repository by Jayna, Emma, and Cristina. We are exploring animal bite data reported to the Louisville Metro Department of Public Health and Wellness. 

This data is to help the public understand the importance in vaccinating pets and livestock from rabies, and also the possible vectors for this virus. Rabies is a preventable disease, but in order for a stop animal - human transmission state and local governments must implement laws for vaccination of privately owned animals. By creating models and diagrams we hope to show how vaccinations have helped reduce the spread of rabies, as well as tracking wildlife that potentially exposed a person to rabies. 

Questions we focuseed on with this data set were:
- What animals are most likely to bite?
- What species make up the positive rabies results?
- Is there a correlation between sex and number of bites reported?
- Do rabid animals bite a certain part of the body more commonly?

By examining and cleaning this data set we realized how important it is in research to input data corretly and neatly for the utmost accuracy in dveloping conclusions. Our conclusions could not be verified due to the abundant amount of "NAs" withing the data.
