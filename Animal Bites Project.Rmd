## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(paletteer)
library(janitor)
library(here)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
animal_bites <- readr::read_csv("Health_AnimalBites.csv")%>%clean_names()
```
```{r}
animal_bites
```
```{r}
animal_bites <- animal_bites%>%
  naniar::replace_with_na(replace=list(gender_id_desc="UNKNOWN", results_id_desc="UNKNOWN", disposition_id_desc="UNKNOWN"))
animal_bites
```

```{r}
animal_bites%>%
  count(breed_id_desc)%>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

```{r}
animal_bites%>%
  naniar::miss_var_summary()
```
```{r}
animal_bites%>%
  separate(bite_date, into=c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-")
```

```{r}
animal_bites%>%
  count(results_id_desc)
```
